Expression Evaluator (Reverse Polish Notation)

You are required to design and implement an expression evaluator
that evaluates mathematical expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

In Reverse Polish Notation:
- Operators follow their operands
- No parentheses are used
- The expression is evaluated from left to right using a stack

The input is a string containing comma-separated tokens.
Each token is either:
- An integer operand
- One of the operators: +, -, *, /

All operands are integers.
Intermediate and final results fit within 32-bit signed integers.

Division should perform integer division and truncate toward zero.

You must evaluate the expression and return the final integer result.

Function to implement:
evaluate_rpn(expression: string) -> int

Rules:
- The expression is guaranteed to be valid
- There will always be enough operands for each operator
- No invalid tokens will appear

Examples:

Input:
"2, 1, +, 3, *"

Explanation:
(2 + 1) * 3 = 9

Output:
9

---

Input:
"4, 13, 5, /, +"

Explanation:
4 + (13 / 5) = 4 + 2 = 6

Output:
6

Constraints:
- Operators supported: +, -, *, /
- Operands are integers
- Expression length can be large
- Use a stack-based evaluation approach

Goal:
Correctly evaluate the given RPN expression and return the result.
