Question
You are building a system to aggregate price updates from multiple feeds to reconstruct the price history of an asset.

Part 1 — Merge Price Changes
You are given K sorted lists of Price Change events. Each list represents a stream of updates from a source (e.g., an exchange). Each event is a tuple [timestamp, price_change].

Your task is to merge these K lists into a single sorted list of Absolute Prices. The absolute price is the cumulative sum of all price changes up to that point in time. Assume the initial price at time 0 is 0.

Rules
Sort by Timestamp: The output list must be sorted by timestamp in ascending order.
Aggregate Deltas: If multiple price changes occur at the exact same timestamp (across same or different lists), sum their deltas together for that timestamp before calculating the new price.
Cumulative Sum: The output value should be the absolute price (running total), not the delta.
Input Constraints:
Each input list is sorted by timestamp (strictly increasing).
Timestamps are positive integers.
Example 1
Input:

feed1 = [[1, 5], [4, -2]]
feed2 = [[2, 3], [4, 1]]
Explanation:

T=1: feed1 adds +5. Current Price = 0 + 5 = 5. Output: [1, 5]
T=2: feed2 adds +3. Current Price = 5 + 3 = 8. Output: [2, 8]
T=4: feed1 adds -2, feed2 adds +1. Net change = -1. Current Price = 8 - 1 = 7. Output: [4, 7]
Output:

[[1, 5], [2, 8], [4, 7]]
