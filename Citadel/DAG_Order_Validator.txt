DAG Order Validator

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and a list of nodes,
determine if the list represents a valid topological sort of the graph.

A topological sort of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that
for every directed edge u -> v, node u appears before node v in the ordering.

Function to implement:
is_valid_topological_sort(nodes: List[str], edges: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> bool

Parameters:
- nodes: A list of node labels representing the proposed topological order
- edges: A list of directed edges (u, v) where u must come before v

Return:
- True if the given node list is a valid topological sort, otherwise False

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
nodes = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
edges = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("A", "C"), ("C", "D")]

Output:
True

Explanation:
All edges satisfy the ordering:
- A before B
- B before C
- A before C
- C before D

Example 2:
Input:
nodes = ["D", "B", "A", "C"]
edges = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C")]

Output:
False

Explanation:
Node A appears after B, which violates the edge A -> B.

Constraints:
- 1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
- Edges form a valid DAG (no cycles)
- Each node label is unique
- Edges are only between nodes in the graph
