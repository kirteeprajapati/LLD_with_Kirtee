Question
You are tracking GPS location errors by comparing measured GPS locations against a set of "golden" (reference) locations. Each location has a timestamp, longitude, and latitude. Calculate the total distance error between expected positions (interpolated from golden locations) and actual measured positions.

Problem Description
Given:

golden_locations: A list of reference GPS locations with accurate timestamps
measured_locations: A list of GPS locations from a device being tested
For each measured location, determine its expected position by interpolating between the two surrounding golden locations based on timestamp, then calculate the distance between the expected and measured positions.

Location Class
class Location:
    def __init__(self, time: int, longitude: float, latitude: float):
        self.time = time
        self.longitude = longitude
        self.latitude = latitude
    
    def get_time(self) -> int:
        return self.time
    
    def get_location(self) -> Tuple[float, float]:
        return (self.longitude, self.latitude)
Part 1 — Calculate Distance Error
Implement the function to calculate the total distance error between golden and measured locations.

Function Signature
def get_distance_error(golden_locations: List[Location], 
                       measured_locations: List[Location]) -> float:
    pass

def get_distance(longitude1: float, latitude1: float, 
                 longitude2: float, latitude2: float) -> float:
    """Calculate Euclidean distance between two coordinates."""
    pass

def get_expected_location(start: float, current: float, 
                          current_time: float, total_time: float) -> float:
    """Linear interpolation between start and current based on time ratio."""
    pass
Algorithm
For each measured location, find the corresponding time window in golden locations
Interpolate the expected longitude and latitude based on the time ratio
Calculate the distance between expected and measured coordinates
Sum up all distance errors
Example 1
Input:

golden = [
    Location(0, 0.0, 0.0),
    Location(10, 10.0, 10.0)
]
measured = [
    Location(5, 4.0, 6.0)  # Expected: (5.0, 5.0)
]
Output:

~2.24
Explanation:

At time 5, expected position is halfway: (5.0, 5.0)
Measured position is (4.0, 6.0)
Distance = sqrt((5-4)² + (5-6)²) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41
Example 2
Input:

golden = [
    Location(0, 0.0, 0.0),
    Location(10, 10.0, 0.0),
    Location(20, 20.0, 0.0)
]
measured = [
    Location(5, 4.0, 1.0),
    Location(15, 16.0, 1.0)
]
Output:

~2.83
Explanation:

First measurement at time 5: expected (5.0, 0.0), measured (4.0, 1.0), error ≈ 1.41
Second measurement at time 15: expected (15.0, 0.0), measured (16.0, 1.0), error ≈ 1.41
Total error ≈ 2.83
Constraints
2 <= len(golden_locations) <= 10^5
1 <= len(measured_locations) <= 10^5
Timestamps are strictly increasing in both lists
All timestamps are non-negative integers
Longitude and latitude are floats in range [-180.0, 180.0]
Notes
Use linear interpolation for expected location calculation
Handle edge case where total_time = 0 to avoid division by zero
Both golden and measured location lists are sorted by timestamp
Use Euclidean distance (not Haversine) for simplicity



GPS Error Tracking

You are tracking GPS location errors by comparing measured GPS locations
against a set of accurate reference locations called "golden" locations.

Each location consists of:
- timestamp (integer)
- longitude (float)
- latitude (float)

You are given two lists:
1. golden_locations: reference GPS locations with correct positions
2. measured_locations: GPS readings from a device being tested

Both lists are sorted by timestamp in strictly increasing order.

For each measured location:
- Find the two golden locations whose timestamps surround the measured timestamp
- Linearly interpolate the expected longitude and latitude based on time
- Compute the Euclidean distance between the expected position and
  the measured position

The total GPS error is the sum of distances for all measured locations.

If a measured timestamp lies exactly on a golden timestamp,
the expected location is that golden location.

You must implement a function that returns the total distance error.

Distance metric:
- Use Euclidean distance
- Do NOT use Haversine or spherical distance

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ number of golden locations ≤ 100,000
- 1 ≤ number of measured locations ≤ 100,000
- All timestamps are non-negative integers
- Longitude and latitude values are in range [-180.0, 180.0]

Edge Cases:
- Handle cases where interpolation time interval is zero
- Both input lists are guaranteed to be sorted by timestamp

Goal:
Efficiently compute the total GPS distance error.
