Problem: Reverse Segment of Linked List
Difficulty: Medium

You are given the head of a singly linked list.

Your task is to:
1. Split the linked list into two halves
2. Reverse the second half of the list
3. Interleave the nodes from the first half and the reversed second half
   by alternating nodes, starting with the first half

If the list has an odd number of nodes, the extra node should remain
at the end after interleaving.

You must perform the operation in-place by modifying node pointers.
Do not create new nodes.

Definition:
A singly linked list node is defined as:
- value
- next pointer

Input:
- Head of a singly linked list
- 1 <= number of nodes <= large constraint (up to tens of thousands)
- Node values are integers

Output:
- Head of the modified linked list after reordering

Steps to perform:
1. Find the middle of the linked list using slow and fast pointers
2. Reverse the second half of the list
3. Merge the first half and the reversed second half alternately

Example 1:
Input:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5

Output:
1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3

Explanation:
- First half: 1 -> 2
- Second half: 3 -> 5
- Reversed second half: 5 -> 3
- Interleaved result: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3

Example 2:
Input:
1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 5 -> 9

Output:
1 -> 9 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 5

Example 3:
Input:
1 -> 1 -> 3

Output:
1 -> 3 -> 1
