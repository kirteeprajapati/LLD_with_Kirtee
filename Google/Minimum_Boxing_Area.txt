Minimum Boxing Area

You are required to design a data structure that maintains a dynamic set of points
on a 2D Cartesian plane.

Each point is represented as (x, y).

The data structure must support the following operations:

1. Insert a point (x, y) into the set.
2. Remove a point (x, y) from the set. It is guaranteed that the point exists.
3. Query the minimum area of an axis-aligned bounding box that contains
   all the points currently present in the set.

The bounding box edges must be parallel to the x-axis and y-axis.

If the set of points is empty, the query operation should return 0.

Constraints:
- Coordinates x and y can be large (up to 10^9 in magnitude).
- The total number of operations can be up to 10^5.
- Insert and remove operations may occur in any order.
- Duplicate points may exist.

Goal:
Efficiently support all operations, especially the bounding box area query.
