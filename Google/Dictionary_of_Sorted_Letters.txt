Problem: Dictionary of Sorted Letters
Difficulty: Medium

You are given a string s where the characters are sorted in non-decreasing (alphabetical) order.

Your task is to identify all characters that appear more than twice in the string.
For each such character, record:
- the character itself
- the total number of times it appears
- the index of its first occurrence
- the index of its last occurrence

Indices are zero-based.

Return the result as a list of lists, where each inner list contains:
[character, count, first_index, last_index]

If no character appears more than twice, return an empty list.

Input:
- A string s
- 1 <= length of s <= 80
- s contains only lowercase English letters
- s is already sorted alphabetically

Output:
- A list of lists describing characters that appear more than twice

Example 1:
Input:
s = "pajbsbactdke"

Output:
[
  ["a", 3, 2, 6],
  ["b", 3, 4, 5],
  ["c", 3, 8, 8]
]

Explanation:
- 'a' appears 3 times, first at index 2, last at index 6
- 'b' appears 3 times, first at index 4, last at index 5
- 'c' appears 3 times, first at index 8, last at index 8

Example 2:
Input:
s = "daybrc"

Output:
[]

Explanation:
No character appears more than twice.
