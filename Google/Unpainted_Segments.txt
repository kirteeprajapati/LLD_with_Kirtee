Problem Name: Unpainted Segments
Difficulty: Medium

Problem Statement:
You are given a number line and a sequence of painting operations.
Each painting operation is represented as an interval [L, R].

For every operation:
1. Calculate the total length of the segment within [L, R] that has NOT been painted by any previous operation.
2. Record this length as the result for the current operation.
3. Paint the entire interval [L, R], so it is considered painted for future operations.

All operations are processed in the given order.

Your task is to return an array where each element corresponds to the unpainted length calculated for each operation.

Definitions:
- Painting an interval marks every point in that interval as painted.
- Overlapping painted regions should not be counted again.

Input:
- An integer N representing the number of operations.
- A list of N intervals, where each interval is [L, R].

Output:
- An array of N integers.
- The i-th integer represents the length of the unpainted portion of interval [L, R] during the i-th operation.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9
- Operations must be processed sequentially.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
Intervals = [[4, 40], [8, 18], [23, 37], [1, 80]]

Output:
[36, 0, 5, 28]

Explanation:
- Operation 1 paints [4, 40], unpainted length = 36
- Operation 2 overlaps completely with painted region, unpainted length = 0
- Operation 3 paints [23, 37], only [36, 40] is new → length = 5
- Operation 4 paints [1, 80], unpainted segments are [1,4) and (40,80] → length = 28
