Word Wrap Problem

We want to arrange words into lines, connecting them with hyphens -, while ensuring that:

No line exceeds maxLen characters (including hyphens).

Words are kept in order.

Words that are longer than maxLen cannot fit → skip them.

Return a list of formatted lines.

Example

Input:

words = ["a", "b", "kd", "r"]
maxLen = 10


Output:

["a-b-kd-r"]


Explanation:

Total length with hyphens: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 ≤ 10 → fits in one line.

Edge Case:

words = ["eowd", "col_ldnt"]
maxLen = 3


Output:

[]


Both words exceed maxLen → no line can be formed.

Approach

Initialize an empty current line list and current length counter.

Iterate over the words:

If word length > maxLen → skip it.

If adding word (and hyphen if line not empty) exceeds maxLen → finalize current line and start a new one.

Else → append word to current line.

After loop → append any remaining words as the last line.

Join words in each line with -.

Python Implementation


from typing import List

def word_wrap(words: List[str], maxLen: int) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_line = []
    current_len = 0
    
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > maxLen:
            continue  # skip words that can't fit
        
        # Calculate new length if we add this word
        added_len = len(word) + (1 if current_line else 0)  # add 1 for hyphen if line not empty
        
        if current_len + added_len > maxLen:
            # finalize current line
            if current_line:
                result.append('-'.join(current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_len = len(word)
        else:
            if current_line:
                current_len += 1  # hyphen
            current_line.append(word)
            current_len += len(word)
    
    if current_line:
        result.append('-'.join(current_line))
    
    return result


Test Cases

print(word_wrap(["a", "b", "kd", "r"], 10))   # ["a-b-kd-r"]
print(word_wrap(["eowd", "col_ldnt"], 3))    # []
print(word_wrap(["n", "b", "xd", "e"], 4))   # ["n-b", "xd-e"]


This ensures all words are wrapped into lines properly with hyphens without exceeding maxLen.
