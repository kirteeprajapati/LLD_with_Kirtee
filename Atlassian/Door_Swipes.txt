Door Swipes
Problem

You are given a list of door badge records in the format:

badge_records = [
  ["Murnhk", "enter"],
  ["Pzur", "exit"],
  ["Msryhf", "exit"],
  ["Mxrxhn", "enter"],
  ["Jnnbiheo", "exit"],
  ["Piux", "enter"],
  ["Cmrcil", "exit"],
]


Each record is [name, action] where action is "enter" or "exit".

Goal: Identify:

People who entered without a badge: someone who entered twice in a row or started with an "enter" while they weren’t previously inside.

People who exited without a badge: someone who exited twice in a row or exited while they weren’t inside.

Rules / Observations

Keep track of each person’s current state (inside or outside).

Initial state is assumed outside.

Iterate over records sequentially:

"enter":

If already inside → add to entered without badge.

Else → mark as inside.

"exit":

If already outside → add to exited without badge.

Else → mark as outside.

At the end, any remaining inside people may also be flagged depending on requirement (optional).

Example

Input:

badge_records = [
  ["Piux", "enter"],
  ["Cmrcil", "exit"],
  ["Mjrohx", "exit"],
  ["Piux", "enter"],
]


Output:

[['Piux', 'Cmrcil'], ['Mjrohx']]


Explanation:

"Piux" entered first → okay.

"Cmrcil" exited without prior entry → flagged.

"Mjrohx" exited without prior entry → flagged.

"Piux" entered again while inside → flagged for entering without badge.

Implementation Hints

Use a set or dict to track people currently inside.

Use two sets/lists to track violators for "entered without badge" and "exited without badge".

Return lists in lexicographical order if needed.
