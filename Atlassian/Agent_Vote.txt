Question
Design a Customer Support Ticket System that allows customers to rate support agents on a scale of 1 to 5.

You need to implement functionality to:

Accept a rating for an agent.
Calculate the average score for each agent.
Return a list of agents sorted by their average score in descending order.
Requirements
Input: A stream of (agent_id, score) pairs.
Output: A sorted list of agent IDs.
Tie-breaking: If two agents have the same average score, define a strategy to handle the tie
Example
Input:

rate("A", 5)
rate("B", 3)
rate("A", 3)
Calculations:

Agent A: (5 + 3) / 2 = 4.0
Agent B: 3.0 / 1 = 3.0
Output: ["A", "B"]

Part 2 — Weighted Voting System
Design a specialized Voting Data Structure for a ranking system.

Unlike the simple average score, this system uses a weighted ranking mechanism.

Rules
Each vote provides a ranked list of candidates (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd choice).
Points are awarded based on position:
1st place: 3 points
2nd place: 2 points
3rd place: 1 point
The system should support adding votes and calculating the final ranking based on total points.
Task
Implement a class that supports:

addVote(List<String> candidates): Records a vote where candidates are ordered by preference.
getRankings(): Returns the list of candidates sorted by total points.
Example
Input:

Vote 1: [A, B, C]  -> A=3, B=2, C=1
Vote 2: [B, A, C]  -> B=3, A=2, C=1
Totals:

A: 3 + 2 = 5
B: 2 + 3 = 5
C: 1 + 1 = 2
Output: [A, B, C] (Assuming tie-break by name or other rule)

Constraints
Scores are integers between 1 and 5.
Timestamps are integers.
Prices are numbers.
