Problem: Friend Requests Sent

Difficulty: Medium

You are given a list of integers where each integer represents the age of a user in a social network.

Each user may send friend requests to other users based on the following rules:

Rules:
1. A user A will NOT send a friend request to user B if:
   - age[B] <= age[A] / 2 + 7

2. A user A will NOT send a friend request to user B if:
   - age[B] > age[A]

3. If age[B] > 100 and age[A] < 100, then user A will NOT send a friend request to user B.

Otherwise, user A will send a friend request to user B.

For each user, calculate how many friend requests they send.
Return the result as a list where the i-th value represents the number of requests sent by the i-th user.

Input:
- A list of integers ages
- 1 <= length of ages <= 100000
- 1 <= ages[i] <= 190

Output:
- A list of integers representing friend requests sent per user

Example 1:
Input:
[13, 16, 17]

Output:
[0, 2, 2]

Explanation:
- Age 13 cannot send requests to anyone due to the age rule.
- Age 16 can send requests to users aged 16 and 17.
- Age 17 can send requests to users aged 16 and 17.

Example 2:
Input:
[29, 33, 45]

Output:
[1, 1, 0]

Example 3:
Input:
[171, 508, 105]

Output:
[2, 8, 2]

Example 4:
Input:
[171, 60, 90]

Output:
[0, 1, 0]

Notes:
- A user cannot send a friend request to themselves.
- Friend requests are directional.
