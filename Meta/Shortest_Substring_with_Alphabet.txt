Problem: Friend Requests Sent
Difficulty: Medium

You are given a list of integers where each integer represents the age of a user in a social network.

Each user may send friend requests to other users based on the following rules.

Rules:
1. A user A will NOT send a friend request to user B if:
   age[B] <= age[A] / 2 + 7

2. A user A will NOT send a friend request to user B if:
   age[B] > age[A]

3. A user A will NOT send a friend request to user B if:
   age[B] > 100 AND age[A] < 100

If none of the above conditions are violated, user A sends a friend request to user B.

Notes:
- A user cannot send a friend request to themselves.
- Friend requests are directional. If A sends a request to B, it does not imply B sends one to A.

Input:
- An array of integers ages
- 1 <= ages.length <= 100000
- 1 <= ages[i] <= 190

Output:
- An array where the i-th element represents the number of friend requests sent by the i-th user.

Example 1:
Input:
[13, 16, 17]

Output:
[0, 2, 2]

Example 2:
Input:
[29, 33, 45]

Output:
[1, 1, 0]

Example 3:
Input:
[171, 508, 105]

Output:
[2, 8, 2]

Example 4:
Input:
[171, 60, 90]

Output:
[0, 1, 0]
